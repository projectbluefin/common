# Version gates for setup hooks, recorded in $SETUP_CHECKER_FILE.
# :target_versioning_name: Whatever you want to name your versioning tag. Please keep it always the same
# :type_of_service: Must be either `user`, `privileged`, or `system`
# :version: Target version to check/apply to your file
#
# Preferred for new and migrated hooks — record the version only on success:
#   version-script-check tailscale user 1 || exit 0   # read-only gate at the top of the hook
#   ... your setup work ...
#   version-script-commit tailscale user 1            # record success at the end, only on success
#
# version-script-check records nothing, so a hook whose body fails (offline
# machine, masked unit, missing package) never reaches the commit and retries
# on the next boot instead of being permanently, silently skipped
# (projectbluefin/common#1137).
#
# Note: check and commit take the lock independently, so the pair is NOT
# mutually exclusive across processes — two concurrent runs of the same hook
# with the same key can both pass the gate before either commits. Unlike
# version-script, which checks and records under one lock, the split API only
# guarantees that each individual read or write is atomic. hookrunner runs
# hooks sequentially per service and the user/system/privileged keys differ, so
# this does not happen in practice; keep it in mind for new callers.
#
# Legacy check-and-record, kept unchanged for existing callers (including
# downstream images that ship this library):
#   version-script tailscale user 1 || exit 0
# version-script records the version before the hook body runs, so a failing
# body is still skipped on later runs. Migrate hooks to the pair above.
